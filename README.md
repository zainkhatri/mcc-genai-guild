# Islamic GenAI Guild
# **MCC * MTC**

Welcome to the **Islamic GenAI Guild**! This project is all about using AI responsibly to support Islamic knowledge and principles. We're building datasets, grading AI tools, and evaluating how well they handle Islamic topics like the Quran, Hadith, ethics, and more.

## What We're Doing (subject for approval/change)

1. **Creating Datasets**  
   - Collecting Q&A pairs about Islamic topics like Fiqh, Aqeedah, and contemporary issues.
   - Public datasets for training, hidden ones for testing.

2. **Grading AI Tools**  
   - Testing tools like GPT-4 and others on accuracy, ethics, and bias detection.
   - Giving them grades (A, B, Câ€¦) and showing how they can improve.

3. **Making a Leaderboard**  
   - Ranking AI tools based on their performance.
   - Showing which ones are best for specific topics, like Quranic Tafsir or Islamic history.
